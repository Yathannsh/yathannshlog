<h3>Google Code-in</h3>
<div align="justify">
<p>Google code-in is a boot camp for youngsters to the open source world. <a href="http://fossasia.org" target="_blank">FOSSASIA </a>with its goal of inspiring and uniting communities across borders and ages is participating as a mentoring organization for the second time this year. Abiding by the philosophy of Free Open Source Software (FOSS),FOSSASIA  brings people together to share, create, develop and make things with Open Technologies and software. It also endorses its commitment to the open source world by organizing Coding Programs, Developer Meetups & Software and Hardware Development Conferences. <br><br>
This Google Code-in I am fortunate to be mentored by experienced FOSSASIA  mentors. It has been a great learning experience up till now, each task has triggered the inquisitive function inside me and motivated me to explore more and more. The task I enjoyed the most yet was the one which involved making a World-Distance Calculator (Task#2), this was the first time where I applied Math and Computer Science to make something remarkable. Task #2 turned out to be more than a task and has provided me with a completely new outlook of learning things and specially Physics & Math. We are being taught Simple Harmonic Motion at school, and the fact that now I am aware about the utility of Computer Science to simulate such phenomenon makes me even more intrigued to learn such concepts and apply them through Computer Science. Moreover, I have started working on making a SHM simulator and also aim at making use of Computer Science to simulate Math functions and Physics phenomenon as often as possible. There are times when we are taught some function in Math but fail to understand its practical use, this is a global problem. Task #2 made me realize that making something out of what you know through Computer Science can improve one’s understanding of concepts by ten folds. <br><br>

Furthermore, the open source philosophy and the culture at FOSSASIA has inspired me to emulate and foster the open source culture at my school’s Computer Club: Turing Fraternity. Today, I taught my juniors how to use git & github and got them kickstarted to FOSS with the hope of seeing them as contributors to the open source one day. It has been and will continue to be an enlightening experience at <a href="http://fossasia.org" target="_blank"> FOSSASIA </a>; I hope I make the most out this opportunity and learn as much as I can.
