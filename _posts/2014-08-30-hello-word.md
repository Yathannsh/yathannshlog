### GAME OF CODES

<br>Turing Fraternity, the computer club of Jayshree Periwal International School is 

organizing Game of Codes 2015 the Annual Inter-School Technology Symposium in the 

third week of January, 2015. 

Named after Mr. Alan Turing, widely regarded as the father of theoretical computer science 

and artificial intelligence, the Turing Fraternity was founded with the novel goal of providing 

a platform for the Tech enthusiasts to meet, socialize and evaluate their skills.<br><br> For the 

technology minded young persons in Rajasthan, the Turing Fraternity with its aim of 

developing a Tech Culture in this desert state, shines as a welcome beacon of light.  The 

organization serves as a portal for drawing inspiration and support for the average geek. 

The annual Tech symposium titled the Games of Codes serves to quench the tech thirst of 

a geek, much as the Olympics does for the Sports minded and the Model United Nations 

does for  a nascent  diplomat. This will be the club's first ever event and I am more than excited to make it happen. For more information about the event, log on to the the club's <a href ="http://turingf.org">website.</a>
